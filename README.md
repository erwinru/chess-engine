# chess-engine

You can either play a normal chess game against yourself or a friend or against an AI.

Just clone the repository and install all requirements via pip.

Then go to the src folder and execute the game with `python game.py`. You will be asked wheter you
want to play against yourself or against an AI.

The AI is based on a simple Min-Max algorithm and looks ahead 2 moves. It's therefore not the best
AI to play against.
